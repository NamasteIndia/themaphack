</details>

**<details><summary>1. is it safe?</summary>**
<p>
I can not guarantee you that this mod is 100% safe from being banned, but i can minimize the banned risk up to 98% as long as you follow my guidance

Why 98% its because the rest 2 % is depend on your playstyle and report from other player

Playstyle means your behavior when using mod "dont make it too obvious" it will lead you to report by others player.

As long as you follow [this guide](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9z_tA6EC6ypZM4oP4Jfc-gqQXQlyVbsMalOlqVTeBttmrYQ/viewform) consistently your account will be safe.

**<details><summary>2. Why not share bypass guide in public?</summary>**
<p>
Offcourse due to avoid m00nt0n detection.
The less people knows is better, so keep this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9z_tA6EC6ypZM4oP4Jfc-gqQXQlyVbsMalOlqVTeBttmrYQ/viewform">valuable </a> info just for yourself
</p>
</details>

**<details><summary>3. Why key duration is only for 24h ?</summary>**
<p>
Our keygen server has limited resources so by limit duration it will minimize server load
</p>
</details>

**<details><summary>4. Why only maphack and ESP, Where the other features (room info, auto retri, enemy cooldown, auto combo heroes, etc) ?</summary>**
<p>
I made it like that on purpose because features you mentioned above had high banned rate.

Considering that TMH source code is not obfuscated, it will be so easy for antich**t system to detect.

Unless you use [VIP version](https://themaphack.com/getvip) all features you mentioned above is unlocked with latest bypass to avoid detection. Even you got secret feature that i cant mention here
</p>
</details>

**<details><summary>5. Can i have web panel source code that you used in your keygen web?</summary>**
<p>
Absolutely yes, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/panel-source-php-134150729">Download here</a>
